# Research Catalyst

Research Catalyst is a web application designed to assist users in digesting research papers, books, or any other text-based documents effectively. Leveraging the capabilities of Gemini, it provides users with summarized content and key points in easily understandable language. Additionally, it offers an audio version of the summaries, allowing users to listen to the content. Moreover, Research Catalyst includes a chatbot feature that enables users to ask questions about the provided document, and the bot answers within the context of the document.



## Features
### Upload Document
Start by uploading a PDF, DOCX, or text file containing the research paper or book you want to analyze.


### Choose Option
Once the document is uploaded, you'll be presented with two options:

- Summary: Get a summarized version of the document.
- Key Points: Receive key points extracted from the document.

### View and Listen
After selecting an option, Research Catalyst will display the content in a meaningful way, making it easy for you to understand. You can also listen to an audio version of the content for convenience.


### Ask Questions
Use the chatbot to ask questions about the document. The chatbot will respond based on the context of the provided document.
